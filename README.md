Master course tought at [Freie Universität Berlin](http://fu-berlin.de) in the 
**M.Sc. Geological Sciences** program.

## Course summary

This lecture provides an introduction to **dynamical systems** with an emphasis to geosciences. 

We will define several  **mathematical concepts** for physical processes:

- **Flux:**
Movement of a quantity in space and time through a surface (heat, current, water, mass, ...)
- **Continuity:**
Transport of a quantity (mass, energy, momentum, charge, ...) through space and time.
- **Motion:**
Velocity of quantity induced by surface and body forces.
- **Material:**
Behaviour of material to applied forces.

We will complement our mathematical description with examples from the Earth, e.g.
**Heat transport**, **Gravity**, and **Flow in crust and mantle**

### Course How-To

- You should follow the lectures, preferrably in consecutive order.
- In each lecture, we start with an overview, then as main part the self-learning lecture notes can be downloaded.
- Then, a practical part follows, which is often a link to a python page for simple programming exercises, or some homework.

## Lectures

The lecture series is compiled as handouts in **pdf** format:

- [Lecture 0: Overview](handouts/Lecture_Dynamics_00_Overview_handout.pdf)
- [Lecture 1: Introduction](handouts/Lecture_Dynamics_01_Introduction_handout.pdf)
- Lecture 2: Flux
- Lecture 3: Continuity
- Lecture 4: Gravity
- Lecture 5: Motion
- Lecture 6: Elastic
- Lecture 7: Viscous
- Lecture 8: Reactions
- Lecture 9: Shallow water

## Exercises

The exercises are mainly **jupyter** notebooks, which can be accessed through:

- [Juypter notebooks](index.ipynb)
